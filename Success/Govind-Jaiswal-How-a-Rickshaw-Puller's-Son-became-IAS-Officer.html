                        <p>

                            Once an 11-year-old boy, the son of an illiterate rickshaw puller, went to play at his considerably rich and respected friend’s house. Minutes later, he was insulted, disgraced and literally thrown out. The educated man yelled at him,<i>“How dare you come here and mix with my son; don’t you know who you are and where you belong?”</i> Vindictive taunts and phrases like 'However much you study, you will still be a rickshaw-puller’ son, ‘What is your worth? You can only take your father’s business a bit further’, ‘Your father’s one rickshaw can become two or three tomorrow with your initiation’ were very common in his life to stumble upon on a daily basis.
                        </p><p>
                        Govind is from Varanasi, born in a family of three sisters and he is the youngest brother. They had no other option except to live in a 12×8 ft rented room as his father being a rickshaw puller and mother being a housewife. Govind has completed his schooling from a government school in Usmanpura and did his graduation in maths from the government degree college.
                        </p><p>
                        He had this question <b>‘What to do so that people start respecting me?’</b> knocked his deep and the answer, he received from somebody, <b>‘Either you request your father to change his profession or you become big’</b> shook him from inside. It was impossible for him to change the profession of his father so he chose the second. 

                        </p><p>
                        An 11 year old Govind did not know what it took to become an IAS officer but he knew he will do his every bit to see himself where he wanted to. Govind started spending most of his time studying with cotton jammed in his ears to stop the extreme clatter of printing machines and generators of his neighbourhood. His father somehow managed a math tuition for him by investing all his hard work, energy and courage to make his son’s dream come true.  
                        </p><p>
                              He studied in government school and college and took advantage of students’ library. Later, on completion of graduation, he was sent to Delhi with Rs. 40,000 that his father managed by selling his only remaining piece of land. Govind ensured his father’s investment don’t go in vain and studied 18 hours a day. He often skipped one or two meals a day to save money and practiced rigorously. 
                        </p><p>
                        In 2006, one of the most emotional and proudest moments came in his life when 23 year old Govind ranked #48 among 474 successful candidates in the Civil Services Exam. Unlike most of the toppers, it was his very first attempt.
                        </p><p>
                        <b><i>"Beyond this year, my father could not have afforded to send Govind any more money. It was getting very tough for him. Govind was earning Rs 1,500 from tuitions, I don't know what he would have done if he didn't make it to the IAS this year. My father could not sleep for 10 days before the results came,"</i></b> says Govind's eldest sister Nirmala.

                        </p><p>
                           Just like all of us he also had reasons as to why he can’t become successful but he did not make those reasons his excuses. 
                        </p><p>
                        In an interview after successful medical procedures, which is mandatory for IAS, Govind said,               
                        </p><p>
                            <b><i>“Anyone who can understand my hardships and circumstances will realize that I had no other option. Neither I could go for a lower government jobs as they are mostly fixed nor I could start a business as I had no money for it. I went for the option I was left with: worked hard on studies.” </i></b>
                        </p><p>
                            His success dramatically changed his life forever.

                        </p><p>
                            Today, Govind Jaiswal is a respected IAS officer whose story inspires and motivates thousands of youths across India.

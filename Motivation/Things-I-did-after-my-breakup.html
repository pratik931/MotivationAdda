                         I remember my break-up days.
                        </p><p>
                        <b>Oh,the horror!</b>
                        </p><p>
                        Every night I was witnessing horrifying dreams of my ex. In most of those dreams,I saw her wearing saree (Looking gorgeous, of course) and ignoring me like anything. This part exactly would hurt me like hell! I barely could get up from my bed in the morning. I did not feel to go to office. Life had come to a standstill.  The most horrifying experience was the realization that every second I am missing something,something that I don't know but very important in my life. <b>I cried, cried and cried, like a Bit*h!</b>
                        </p><p>
                           I decided to move on. But, again that freaking part of me stroke with very same question - How? How can you be happy without her? How can you be happy when all your dreams seem to fall apart? How can you forget about that someone special with whom you spent unconditionally, selflessly four years? How? Period.
                        </p><p>
                        <b>On deeper introspection, I found the more I ask 'How' and 'Why',  the more I feel the pain and become anxious.</b>
                        </p><p>
                        <b>I understood the game!</b>
                        </p><p>
                        <b>One good day, I accepted!. I accepted the fact that time and people change. They change, no matter how good time we both spent together, our circumstance changed and so were we.</b>
                        </p><p>
                       <b>By just then, I was entering into the second phase of Grief- Acceptance!</b>
                        </p><p>
                        My mind started accepting the fact that we are done. I am no longer in relationship. She is no more my girlfriend and therefore, there is no need to feel sorry for her.<b>This acceptance feeling relieved me.</b> I started thinking about other stuffs of my life, which were long pending due to my busy schedule in long- distance relationship maintenance .
                        </p><p>
                            After some days, I thought, I must congratulate her and wish her for new life. I just made a call to have a brief conversation with her (just to end it up nicely). Firstly, she did not pick up my calls. I thought it was Okay. But after few hours she made a call. I picked. I was talking to her after two-three months of our unofficial break-up. But to my wonder, the person was changed completely in these months. She was not anymore the same girl. In most of the that phone call duration, as far as I can remember, she  kept iterating that she got another BF and she is very happy or want to be happy with him. She also mentioned that her new Bf is far better than me. I was hurt but internally I was happy for her. A silver lining of  her this attitude was, I later realized, that I felt relieved knowing the fact she had moved on and more because, she was honest and looked for her own way to happiness.  Suppressing all my pain at that moment, I replied her:
                        </p><p>
                        <b><i>""Well, that you made it easier for me, Good luck!"</i></b> and hung up the phone.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>After this brief conversation I realized love relationships are not always meant to be end up nicely. And those who take it positively, learn many things. I cannot recall any other incidence in my life except break up that changed my life so drastically. Though it still hurts me but I learnt better to control my mind and my heart. I became a humble, sincere and positive person.  I taught myself through reading so many books and websites.</b>
                        </p><p>
                            And in following months, our relationship went on to a silent death​!
                        </p><p>
                        On contrary to our perception that breaks-ups should always be ended up nicely, most break-ups are often messy and it is absolutely normal.  During breaking-up a relationship we are driven by emotional temperament of our brain rather than the rational part.
                        </p><p>
                        <b>The painful experience during break-up is precious, preserve it!</b> If you were honest in relationship and breaking up is due to inhospitable circumstances, I can guarantee that this incidence would teach you some very precious lessons of life. I came to know myself better while passing through that painful break-up. There is no doubt that Break-ups suck and you would think this is the worst that can happen with you. But believe me, it will over! It will over soon and you will emerge stronger than ever before. These things are just part of our life. <b>These experiences are what make our life interesting. Accept it,take the lessons and move on!</b>
                        </p><p>
                        Now after exactly one and half a year my break-up I must admit, I got over! It was not easy. It was tough but i did it. It was a good learning experience. I came to know how sensitive and delicate emotions can be and I would of course think not twice but thrice before trading them off with anyone special in future.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here, this reminds me a famous quotation:
                        </p><p style="text-align:center;color:gray">
                            “And once the storm is over, you won’t remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won’t even be sure whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain, when you come out of the storm, you won’t be the same person who walked in. That’s what this storm’s all about.”
                        </p><p>
